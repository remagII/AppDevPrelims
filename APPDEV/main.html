            He became the leader of the Propaganda Movement, contributing
            numerous articles to its newspaper, La Solidaridad, published in
            Barcelona. Rizal’s political program included integration of the
            Philippines as a province of Spain, representation in the Cortes
            (the Spanish parliament), the replacement of Spanish friars by
            Filipino priests, freedom of assembly and expression, and equality
            of Filipinos and Spaniards before the law.

          <p class="details-text">
            In 1887 Rizal published his first novel, Noli me tangere (The Social
            Cancer), a passionate exposure of the evils of Spanish rule in the
            Philippines. A sequel, El filibusterismo (1891; The Reign of Greed),
            established his reputation as the leading spokesman of the
            Philippine reform movement.

          <p class="details-text">
            Rizal returned to the Philippines in 1892. He founded a
            nonviolent-reform society, the Liga Filipina, in Manila, and was
            deported to Dapitan in northwest Mindanao.

            He remained in exile for the next four years. In 1896 the Katipunan,
            a Filipino nationalist secret society, revolted against Spain.
            Although he had no connections with that organization and he had had
            no part in the insurrection, Rizal was arrested and tried for
            sedition by the military.

          <p class="details-death">
            Found guilty, he was publicly executed by a firing squad in Manila.
            His martyrdom convinced Filipinos that there was no alternative to
            independence from Spain. On the eve of his execution, while confined
            in Fort Santiago, Rizal wrote “Último adiós” (“Last Farewell”), a
            masterpiece of 19th-century Spanish verse.
